#### Install steps

Install everything (main + dev packages except optional groups)

```sh
peotry install
```

Install main packages only

```sh
peotry install --only main

```

If you need pre-commit

```sh
poetry install --with commit
```

If you decided to install pre-commit you can install .pre-commit files in your repo

```sh
peotry run pre-commit install -t pre-commit
poetry run pre-commit install -t pre-push
```

If the files are git staged, you can trigger pre-commit manually

```sh
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
poetry run pre-commit run --hook-stage push -v
```

#### Makefile
